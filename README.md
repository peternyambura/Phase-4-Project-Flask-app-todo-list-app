# Our Flask TO DO Application with React and Flask

This is a simple to-do list application built with Flask for the backend and potentially React for the frontend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3
- Pipenv (for managing dependencies)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Install Pipenv**  
   If you don't have Pipenv installed, you can install it using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install pipenv
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/peternyambura/Phase-4-Project-Flask-app-todo-list-app.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Change into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Phase-4-Project-Flask-app-todo-list-app
   ```

4. **Start the Pipenv Shell**  
   Spawn a shell within the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   pipenv shell
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages using the Pipfile:
   ```sh
   pipenv install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` or another port if specified in the application settings.
